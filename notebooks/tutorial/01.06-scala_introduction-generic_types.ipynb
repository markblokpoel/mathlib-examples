    "In the previous section we learned about collections. Collections in Scala are what is called generic. The change their type depending on the values you apply to them. For example, the list containing the forecast consists of values of type ```Double```, therefore the type of forecast is ```List[Double]```. In Scala, the type of a generic includes the type of its contents denoted between square brackets. "

    "While to some generic types might seem constraining, they actually afford some very powerful ways of working with collections. Because collections can be generic, one does not need to define what a set of integers is separate from a set of Booleans and a set of doubles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not coding your own collections, we can manimupate them without any errors or unpredictable side effects. You can apply functions to all of the elements because all elements in a collection are of the same type. You've seen an examples of this in [Section 1.5.3](01.05-scala_introduction-collections.ipynb#1.5.3-Working-with-collections) on using the ```.map``` function.\n",

    "The way generics work is similar to an organized file cabinet. Because everything has its defined place, it is easier to work with and you make less mistakes. This comes at the cost of some flexibility and additional upfront bookkeeping. The alternative would be to just chuck everything in, which is very flexible and has no upfront cost. But then working with such an disorganized cabinet is much harder as you will need to search, verify and decide for each item. Both ways work and are valid, each having their own pros and cons.\n",
