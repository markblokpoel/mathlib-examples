    "We cover only a small subset of the full Scala language here. This subset suffices for implementing basic simulations of formal theories. If after reading this chapter you want to learn more about Scala, there are various textbooks (e.g. Odersky, Spoon and Venners, 2019; but see also [Scala books](https://docs.scala-lang.org/books.html)) and online resources such as the official [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) and [Creative Scala](https://www.creativescala.org/).\n",
