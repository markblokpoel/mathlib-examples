    "At some point, you may encounter what are called [anonymous functions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scala-book/anonymous-functions.html). These are shorthands to define a simple functions instead of defining them explicitly. Anonymous functions are like mini-functions and can be defined directly in place of the arguments of another function. It is not necessary to know how to write anonymous functions, but it is useful to be able to recognize and read them. (Though when you become more fluent in Scala, you might want to learn how to write them to save yourself time while coding.)\n",
