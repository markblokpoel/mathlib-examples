    "## 1.2 Blocks and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The notions of *block* and *scope* are important to understand when writing code. At each point in your code, you have access to a subset of all values and variables defined in your code. Whenever a value or variable is in the subset it is *in scope*. What is within scope, depends on the structure of your code which is determined by blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala a *block* is a sequence of expressions delineated by curly brackets. A block evaluates to a value which is the value of the last statement in the block. If no final statement is present, the block evaluates to ```Unit```, a special value denoting nothing. (You will notice that Jupyter lab will not print values with type Unit.)"
